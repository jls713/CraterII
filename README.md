# Notebooks and code associated with Sanders, Evans & Dehnen (2018)

This repo contains notebook and code for 'Tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies: the strange case of Crater II' -- Sanders, Evans & Dehnen (2018), MNRAS submitted.

The bulk of the code is for analysing the N-body simulations, which are run using ``griffin`` and the initial conditions are produced using Walter Dehnen's Made-to-Measure code, both of which are proprietary. This unfortunately means the entirety of the analysis cannot be re-run using this notebook. However, the simulation results can be made available upon request. These notebooks serve to demonstrate how the analysis was done.
